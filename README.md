# CatPhotoApp
Project Description: CatPhotoApp

The CatPhotoApp is a simple, user-friendly web page dedicated to showcasing cute cat photos and fun facts about cats. It features a gallery of cat images, lists highlighting what cats love and hate, and an interactive form for users to submit their own cat photos.

Key Features:
Cat Photo Gallery: View adorable cat photos through links and images.
Cat Lists: Learn about things that cats love (e.g., cat nip, laser pointers, lasagna) and hate (e.g., flea treatment, thunder).
Interactive Cat Form: Users can submit cat photos by filling out a form, choosing whether their cat is indoor or outdoor, and selecting personality traits (loving, lazy, or energetic).
The app is clean and minimalist, making it easy to navigate for cat lovers. It also integrates a form submission process for cat photos, allowing engagement from users. The site is connected to the freeCodeCamp platform, providing resources and inspiration for further coding projects.
